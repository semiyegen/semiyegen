# Semih Yegen - Medical Researcher and Data Scientist

![Profile Image](profile_image_url)

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am Semih Yegen, a passionate medical researcher and data scientist specializing in HIV research and machine learning applications in healthcare.

## About Me

I graduated from Ondokuz MayÄ±s University Medical School in 2019 and have worked as a general practitioner for three years. Since April 2024, I have been observing in the Basic Medical Sciences lab, focusing on HIV pathogen, infection, treatment, and vaccine research. My goal is to continue my research career in the US due to the challenges in translational studies in Turkey. As a closeted gay man in the Middle East, understanding and preventing HIV infection is personally significant to me.
